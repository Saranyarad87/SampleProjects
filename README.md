# Programming test for Canary

## Bubble Sort program

This is an implementation of a bubble sort algorithm. The program prompts an input of the type eg. Numeric or Alphabet for sorting.Once you make a choice enter the list of number or character with spaces and hit ENTER.
The program will output the sorted string or number.

## Alphanumeric Sort

This program will sort an alphanumeric string in the order of numbers,lower case, upper case and other characters. The program will prompt for an input.

 ###### **Design choices for the Alpha numeric sort**
 For this implementation I use python 3 in-built sort and sorted implementation. There seems to some limiation with this function as a special character like '@' would cause the subsequent character/numbers to be treated as special characters as well. As such in those cases the sorting seems to be slightly off.
